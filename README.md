# 2048

This is a python implementation of the classic 2048 game. 

The goal of this game is to reach the 2048 tile by merging tiles strategically without running out of space on the board. 
To do so, users are able to use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the tiles in their respective directions. Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they touch. A user is able to manage their score and create a new high score as they play, and once the game is over, a user is able to restart the game!
